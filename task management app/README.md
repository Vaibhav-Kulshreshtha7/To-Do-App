# To-Do App
A simple to-do list app that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using React.

## Features
- Add new tasks to the list
- Edit existing tasks
- Delete tasks from the list
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Search tasks
- View completed and remaining tasks

## How it Works
The app uses React state and localStorage to manage tasks. When a user adds, edits, deletes, or marks a task, the list updates in real-time and persists across sessions.

## Requirements
- Node.js and npm
- A modern web browser

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` in the project directory.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

## Usage
1. Add a new task using the input field and "Add" button.
2. Edit a task by clicking the pencil icon.
3. Delete a task by clicking the cross icon.
4. Mark a task as complete/incomplete using the checkbox.
5. Use the search bar to filter tasks.
